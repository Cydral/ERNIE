## Project Structure

The source code for ERNIE is organized in the `ERNIE/sources/` directory. This structure keeps the codebase clean and easy to navigate.

### Key Files:

- **`vslm.cpp`**: 
  - Main program file and the core of the ERNIE implementation
  - Contains custom layer extensions for the Dlib library
  - Implements the VSLM (Very Small Language Model) architecture and training logic
  - Includes utility functions and the program's entry point

- **`tokenizer.hpp`**: 
  - Header file containing "readers" for various tokenizer types
  - Currently not directly used by the main program
  - Provides flexibility for future tokenization method implementations

- **`data_fr.h`**: 
  - Contains general text examples in French
  - Used for training a language model from scratch
  - Serves as a sample dataset for initial model development and testing

- **Pre-calculated UNIGRAM Tokenizer Models**:
  - `.model` and `.vocab` files for UNIGRAM tokenizers
  - Includes models for: 3k, 8k, 20k and 40k vocabulary
  - Source corpus details: Transcriptions of European Parliament proceedings and careful alignment of English and French transcriptions (English: ~2 million sentences, French: ~2 million sentences)

### Notes:

1. The main program (`vslm.cpp`) currently includes its own implementation for creating and using a SentencePiece tokenizer, independent of `tokenizer.hpp`.
2. The compact structure with a single main source file (`vslm.cpp`) allows for straightforward management and compilation of the project.
3. `data_fr.h` provides a readily available dataset for initial experiments and demonstrations of the model's capabilities with French language text.
4. The pre-calculated UNIGRAM tokenizer models offer ready-to-use tokenization for different languages (currently EN-FR) and scenarios, enhancing the versatility of the ERNIE project.

To build the project, ensure all source files are included in your build configuration. Set `vslm.cpp` as the main entry point for compilation. When using the pre-calculated tokenizer models, make sure to specify the correct model file in your configuration or code.
